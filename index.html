                    This African dish is packed full of flavor, rich, grainy, smoky, delicious, and the best. 
                    It's a one-pot dish that is made with rice, tomato, peppers, herbs, and spices. 
                    There are different variations of West African Jollof rice including the Nigerian
                    jollof rice, Senegalese, Liberia, and Ghana jollof rice.
                    It has been an intense war about who has the best jollof rice but I would like to clear
                    that and confirm that Nigerian jollof rice is the best.</p>
